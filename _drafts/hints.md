üîπ PostgreSQL Prefetch Configuration Parameters
Here are the key settings that control the WAL prefetch mechanism in PostgreSQL 15+:
It could helps to optimize WAL recovery by reducing I/O stalls and leveraging parallel disk access during replay. üöÄ

1Ô∏è‚É£ wal_decode_buffer_size
	‚Ä¢	Defines the lookahead buffer size for decoding WAL records and determining which blocks need to be prefetched.
	‚Ä¢	A larger buffer allows PostgreSQL to analyze more WAL records in advance and request more pages from disk before they are needed.
	‚Ä¢	Default: 512kB
	‚Ä¢	Recommended tuning: Increase if you have a fast storage system (e.g., NVMe SSDs) to improve efficiency.
```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_decode_buffer_size = '2MB';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ maintenance_io_concurrency
	‚Ä¢	Controls the number of concurrent I/O requests PostgreSQL can issue for maintenance tasks, including WAL prefetching.
	‚Ä¢	Higher values allow PostgreSQL to prefetch more blocks simultaneously instead of waiting for each request to complete before issuing the next one.
	‚Ä¢	Default: 10
	‚Ä¢	Recommended tuning: Increase if you have high IOPS storage (e.g., RAID, SSDs, or tuned Linux I/O schedulers).
```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_io_concurrency = '50';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```
